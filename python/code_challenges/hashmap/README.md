## Code Challenge: Hashtables
### Author: Dominic Giacona



## Approach & Efficiency
### Set:
  Arguments: key, value
  Returns: nothing
  This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.

### Get
  Arguments: key
  Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

### Contains
  Arguments: key
  Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

## Keys
  Returns: Collection of keys

## Hash
  Arguments: key
  Returns: Index in the collection for that key
